# E-Commerce_Customer_Behavior_Analysis
## 1. Project Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional data from 3,900 purchases across various product categories. The goal is to uncover insights into spending patterns, customer segments, product preferences, and subscription behavior to guide strategic business decisions.

## 2. Dataset Summary
* **Rows:** 3,900
* **Columns:** 18
* **Key Features:**
    * Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status)
    * Purchase details (Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount, Season, Size, Color)

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis using Python
Data was cleaned and analyzed using Python with the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading:** Imported the dataset using `Pandas`.
2.  **Initial Exploration:** Used `df.info()` to view structure and `.describe()` for summary statistics.
3.  **Missing Data Handling:** Imputed missing values in `Review Rating` with the median rating per product category.
4.  **Column Standardization:** Converted column names to `snake_case` for consistency.
5.  **Feature Engineering:**
    * Created a new column `age_group` by binning customer ages.
    * Added a `purchase_frequency_days` column by mapping purchase frequency to numeric values.
6.  **Data Consistency Check:** Verified redundancy between `discount_applied` and `promo_code_used`, and dropped `promo_code_used`.
7.  **Database Integration:** Exported the cleaned DataFrame to `MySQL` for SQL-based analysis.

## 4. Data Analysis using SQL (Business Transactions)
Key SQL queries were used to derive insights from the cleaned dataset:

1.  **Revenue by Gender:** Compared total revenue generated by male vs. female customers.
2.  **High Spending Discount Users:** Identified customers who used discounts but spent above the average purchase amount.
3.  **Top 5 Products by Rating:** Found products with the highest average review ratings.
4.  **Shipping Type Comparison:** Compared average purchase amounts between Standard and Express shipping.
5.  **Subscribers vs. Non-Subscribers:** Compared average spend and total revenue across subscription status.
6.  **Discount-Dependent Products:** Identified top 5 products with the highest percentage of discounted purchases.
7.  **Customer Segmentation:** Classified customers into New, Returning, and Loyal segments.
8.  **Top 3 Products per Category:** Listed the most purchased products within each category.
9.  **Repeat Buyers & Subscriptions:** Checked whether customers with >5 purchases were more likely to subscribe.
10. **Revenue by Age Group:** Calculated total revenue contribution of each age group.

## 5. Dashboard in Power BI
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize insights effectively.

It included charts for:
* Revenue by gender, age group, and subscription status
* Top products by category and rating
* Discount vs. purchase amount analysis
* Customer segmentation summary

## 6. Business Recommendations
1.  **Boost Subscriptions:** Promote exclusive benefits for subscribers.
2.  **Customer Loyalty Programs:** Reward repeat buyers to transition them into the loyal segment.
3.  **Review Discount Policy:** Balance discounts with profit margins.
4.  **Product Positioning:** Highlight top-rated and best selling products in marketing campaigns.
5.  **Targeted Marketing:** Focus efforts on high-revenue age groups and express-shipping users.

## 7. Tools & Technologies Used
* **Python:** Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
* **MySQL:** Query based analysis for business insights.
* **Power BI:** Visualization and dashboard creation.
* **GitHub:** Project documentation and version control.
